- Sentiment Summary: Display a summary of the review analysis, including the percentage of positive and negative reviews.
- Detailed Review View: Display individual reviews with their sentiment analysis results highlighted.
- Sentiment Filtering: Filter reviews based on sentiment (positive or negative).
- Intuitive UI: Provide a clean and intuitive user interface for easy navigation and data presentation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calm blue (#6699CC) evoking trust and clarity.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated blue (#F0F8FF). This barely-there blue provides a clean backdrop that lets the other colors 'pop' without being distracting.
- Accent color: A muted green (#8FBC8F) for positive sentiment indicators and call-to-action buttons. Green is analogous to blue on the color wheel.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font, provides a modern, machined, objective, and neutral feel.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent sentiment (e.g., thumbs up/down) and data visualization (e.g., charts and graphs).
- Maintain a clean and organized layout with clear visual hierarchy for easy readability and navigation.
- Incorporate subtle animations to provide feedback on user actions (e.g., loading animations, transitions between views).
